# 📈 AI Stock Predictor

An intelligent web application that leverages the OpenAI API to analyze stock market tickers and generate predictive insights. This project demonstrates the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into a modern frontend architecture built with **Vite**.

> **⚠️ Legal Disclaimer:** This application is for educational and demonstrative purposes only. The predictions generated by the AI are based on probabilistic language patterns and do not constitute professional financial advice. Do not use this tool for actual trading or investment decisions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

  * **Frontend Framework:** React (via Vite for optimized build performance)
  * **AI Engine:** OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo / GPT-4)
  * **Styling:** CSS / CSS Modules
  * **Runtime:** Node.js

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Node.js:** (Version 14.x or higher) - This is the runtime environment required to execute JavaScript outside of a browser.
  * **OpenAI API Key:** You will need a valid API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

### 2\. Installation

Clone the repository (if applicable) and install the necessary dependencies. This process downloads all the external code libraries required for the project to function.

```bash
# Install dependencies listed in package.json
npm install
```

### 3\. Configuration & Security

**Crucial Step:** To communicate with OpenAI, the application needs your personal API Key. For security reasons, we never hard-code credentials directly into the source code. Instead, we use **Environment Variables**.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
2.  Add your API key using the specific Vite syntax:

<!-- end list -->

```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_sk_key_starts_with_sk...
```

> **Note:** The prefix `VITE_` is mandatory. It signals to the Vite build tool that this specific variable is safe to expose to the client-side browser application. Without this prefix, the variable will remain hidden on the server side and the app will not work.

### 4\. Running the Application

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal) to view the application.

## 🔍 Under the Hood: Technical Architecture

For those interested in the computer science concepts applied here, this is how the data flows through the application:

1.  **Input Handling:** The user inputs a stock ticker (e.g., "TSLA"). The React state captures this input.
2.  **API Request Construction:** The application constructs a payload containing a system instruction (the "prompt").
      * *Concept:* We are essentially programming the AI with natural language, instructing it to act as a "financial analyst."
3.  **Asynchronous Communication:** The app sends a `POST` request to OpenAI's endpoint.
      * *Why Asynchronous?* AI generation takes time (latency). We use modern JavaScript (`async/await`) to ensure the user interface doesn't freeze while waiting for the answer.
4.  **Inference & Response:** The model calculates the most statistically probable continuation of the text based on its training data. It returns a JSON object containing the text analysis.
5.  **DOM Manipulation:** React efficiently updates the Document Object Model (the visible page) to render the AI's response without reloading the entire page.
